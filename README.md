#### _Tic Tac Toe_, 04.07.2017

### By _Sam Kirsch_

## Description

#### A basic website built so that uses can play Tic Tac Toe against each other or against the computer. The AI learns as you play against it, avoiding moves that have had negative outcomes before and favoring moves that have proven to be beneficial. The gameMemory is not persistent by design, and the AI will become "fresh" again on a page refresh.

## Specifications

* Users can choose a player name and a symbol
* Users can take turns with each other or a computer to place markers on the board
* The game ends when one player has 3 in a row or the board is filled
* Users can choose to play again

#### Stretch Goals

* Add a button to automatically run computer games to up the difficulty, effectively increasing the AI's "knowledge"

## Setup

* Clone this repository
* Open index.html using a web browser

### Technologies Used

* HTML and CSS
* JavaScript
